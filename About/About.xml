    A rework of the minigun.
    Most of the people think that the minigun is almost useless.
    It has a shitty accuracy and take WAY too much time to fire.

    This mod simple change the behavior of the minigun.

    Some math:

    Consider the following:

    The normal minigun takes 2.5 of aiming time (which in a combat scenario, often keep resetting because someone else shoot
    down the target, and the pawn need to pick someone else)
    Then it takes 2.08 seconds to shoot al its 25 bullets
    And finally, it takes 2.3 seconds of cooldown before the pawn could start all over again.

    This give us, a total time of 6.88 second per cycle.

    Since the accuracy is so low, some people say the “only good way” to use a minigun is to shoot a wall behind a bunch of targets, so the randomness will cause a lot of hits. Otherwise, you may not even shoot in a quick battle.

    But then, what this mod does?
    My goal is not to make the minigun op. Just an interesting option.

    I removed the burst count of the weapon and changed the warm up and cooldown to 0,14.
    So your pawn will take 0,14 to aim, (about 0) to shoot and then, 0,14 of cooldown.
    With these numbers, you will fire, in the same 6.88 seconds, about 24.57 bullets. (which is less!)

    I didn't change the shitty accuracy, or damage or anything else... just removed the time the paws would spend trying to shoot and replaced with the paw actually firing the damn thing.

    Spray and pray my friends.
